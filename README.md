# CS210-Restaurant-Review-Analysis

This project is a comprehensive analysis of personal restaurant reviews. It aims to uncover patterns and insights from dining experiences across various cuisines and locations.

## Project Overview

The motivation for this project is to understand personal dining preferences and factors that contribute to restaurant satisfaction. This analysis takes into consideration various aspects such as food quality, cleanliness, accessibility, and price. The findings of this project may be used to make informed decisions about future restaurant visits and to share experiences with others.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this analysis consists of personal restaurant reviews collected over time. It includes scores for various attributes of dining experiences for a number of restaurants.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA phase involved:

- Statistical summaries of the data
- Visual distributions of individual scores
- Correlation analysis between different review aspects
- Counts and visualizations of restaurant visits by cuisine type

## Machine Learning Models

Several predictive models were built and evaluated:

- Linear Regression to predict overall satisfaction
- Decision Tree and Random Forest models to classify restaurants based on satisfaction levels
- Feature importance analysis to identify factors most influencing satisfaction

## Findings

Key insights from the project include:

- Food quality and cleanliness are the most influential factors in overall satisfaction.
- Price and accessibility, while important, have a lesser impact on the final ratings.
- A diverse range of cuisines has been explored, with certain types frequently visited.

## Limitations and Future Work

- The dataset is limited to personal experiences and may not generalize to a wider audience.
- Some cuisine types have fewer reviews, which may skew the analysis.
- Future work could involve collecting more data, including other factors like service quality, and implementing more complex models.

## How to Use

To replicate this analysis or to analyze your own dataset:

1. Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Replace the dataset with your own, following the same structure.
4. Run the Jupyter notebooks to perform the analysis.
